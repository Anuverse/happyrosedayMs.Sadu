          <span>Dear Di,</span>
          <br />
          On this Rose Day, each petal symbolizes my admiration <br />for you.
          Your presence colors my world with joy and warmth.
          You are the best thing that has happened to me.
          My lifeline, my first friend, my partner in crime, my beauty with brains, my teacher,
          my sadu, my whole universe in short and the most important galaxy that makes Anuverse.
          The white roses signify the purity of our bond.
          In the garden of life, you're my most cherished blossom.
          Thank you for being the source of my happiness, joy, inspiration and sometimes of tears as well. Our journey
          together is as sweet as the fragrance of roses. Happy Rose Day, Ms.Sadu.
          Here's to many more petals of shared laughter and joy.
